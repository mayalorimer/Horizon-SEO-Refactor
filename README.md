# Horizon-SEO-Refactor

## Description

This code's intention is to meet accessability standards and optimize the website for seach engines. The refactor of the original code allows for greater accessability through use of alts and a more condensed and specific organization. Throughout my refactoring of the code I learned the importance of organization to help others understand your code.
